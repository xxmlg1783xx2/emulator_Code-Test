# emulator_Code-Test
I'm just doing this to learn how to do this. Plus I'm bored im school.
So welcome to EMULATE-MAX
An emulator wservice that I'm putting myself through mental pain to make.
So to those at school HAVE THE FILES TO PLAY THIS. That applies to everyone.
I don't want to make a system to prebuild games in to the emulator.
But I still welcome you to EMULATER MAX.
